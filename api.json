      "summary": "Profound psychological events experienced during clinical death or near-death states, characterized by common elements including tunnels, white light, deceased relatives, life review, and out-of-body sensations.",
      "full": "Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) are profound psychological events that occur during clinical death or close brushes with death. First systematically studied and named by Raymond Moody in 1975, NDEs are characterized by common elements across cultures: moving through a tunnel, encountering a brilliant white light, meeting deceased relatives or spiritual beings, experiencing a comprehensive life review, feeling profound peace and unconditional love, and having out-of-body experiences. Experiencers often report temporal distortion, ineffability (difficulty describing the experience), and profound life transformation following the event. Research by investigators including Pim van Lommel, Sam Parnia, and Bruce Greyson has documented thousands of cases. Theories range from spiritual explanations (evidence of afterlife/soul) to neurological explanations (DMT release, oxygen deprivation, temporal lobe stimulation, REM intrusion). Scientific studies like the AWARE study and van Lommel's Dutch study have attempted to investigate NDEs rigorously. Cultural interpretations vary, with religious and spiritual frameworks shaping how the experience is understood. NDEs are related to out-of-body experiences and remain a subject of intense scientific and philosophical interest in consciousness studies."
