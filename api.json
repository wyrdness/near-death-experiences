      "full": "Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) are profound psychological events that occur during clinical death or close brushes with death. First systematically studied and named by Raymond Moody in 1975, NDEs are characterized by common elements across cultures: moving through a tunnel, encountering a brilliant white light, meeting deceased relatives or spiritual beings, experiencing a comprehensive life review, feeling profound peace and unconditional love, and having out-of-body experiences. Experiencers often report temporal distortion, ineffability (difficulty describing the experience), and profound life transformation following the event. Research by investigators including Pim van Lommel, Sam Parnia, and Bruce Greyson has documented thousands of cases. Theories range from spiritual explanations (evidence of afterlife/soul) to neurological explanations (DMT release, oxygen deprivation, temporal lobe stimulation, REM intrusion). Scientific studies like the AWARE study and van Lommel's Dutch study have attempted to investigate NDEs rigorously."
